## Google Maps API Setup

The app uses the Google Maps JavaScript API. Your API key is configured in `.env`:

```
VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=AIzaSyATuZ9W0N4GDGjow5fu9dupwJVpAerYBUY
```

### API Key Restrictions (Recommended)

For security, consider restricting your Google Maps API key:

1. **Application restrictions**: HTTP referrers (websites)
   - Add your domain: `yourdomain.com/*`
   - For development: `localhost:8080/*`

2. **API restrictions**: Limit to required APIs
   - Maps JavaScript API
   - Places API (if needed later)

3. **Quota management**: Set daily request limits to control costs

### Troubleshooting

If the map doesn't load:

1. **Check API Key**: Ensure it's valid and has proper permissions
2. **Check Console**: Look for JavaScript errors in browser dev tools
3. **Check Quotas**: Verify you haven't exceeded Google Maps API limits
4. **Check Network**: Ensure internet connectivity for Google Maps API
